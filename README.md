# Tracking Reported Cases of Illegal Fireworks in 2020
 
Social media has highlighted a surge in fireworks being set off in June of 2020. Some believe that the lockdowns due to the Coronavirus pandemic have led to pent up energy, and the spike in reports of illegal fireworks is explained by the desperate need of entertainment. Others believe in more sinister causes. The ballooning number of cases doesn't exist in a vacuum. The murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis has reignited the United States to reflect on racism that has been fraught throughout the nation's history. With increasing tensions fueled by racial divisions and political ideology, there have been calls to defund the police. Some have speculated that local law enforcement bodies have responded to the protests by planting fireworks into communities across the five boroughs as a wartime tactic. In a since deleted Twitter thread by novelist Robert Jones Jr., he hypothesized that fireworks desensitize the population to incredibly loud noises and causes sleep deprivation leading to confusion in the neighborhoods that have spoke out against police brutality.  

In an age of social media, disinformation/misinformation, and a global pandemic, it's difficult to discern the truth. The ingredients engender conspiracy as we are all trying to make sense of the world. 

There hasn't been some big reveal - no news of whether it was a insidious plot by the NYPD nor a widely accepted explanation that people are simply bored. Even so, I analyze the number of reported cases of fireworks being set off illegally to 311 to answer whether or not there is empirical evidence to back up the widespread anecdotal tales of prolonged firework shows being set off well past bed times. From the plots below, it's clear that June 2020 is an anomoly. In the first subplot I compare the number of incidents reported to 311 in June of 2020 to the number of incidents reported in June of 2019.
- Without question, as we approach the Fourth of July, the number of reports explodes. It remains high and even increases, reaching its peak on the holiday as expected. 
- It may be plausible that this trend held in 2019, so it may not be out of the normal. However, the number of reported cases in the previous year does not even come close to the levels in 2020. Even on the Fourth - when we expect people to celebrate - the number of reported incidents is pale in comparison to this year. 

Arguably, it may be insufficient to compare two years of data. Yet the story holds in the second subplot. When comparing the total number of illegal fireworks being set off in June over the past decade, 2020 is not normal. The bars that represent the number of reports from 2010 to 2019 are almost non-existent when placed on a set of axes alongisde the 2020 data.

For the second part of this brief analysis, I explore the location in which illegal fireworks are reported. Luckily, 311 provides the zip code that corresponds to a report. While the zip code of the reporter is not identical to the zip code of the incident, I assume that the neighborhoods are close enough in proximity. It would be unlikely that a reporter in Union Square would call in to 311 with a complaint of fireworks being set off across the bridge in Brooklyn. The choropleth below shows the number of reported cases of illegal fireworks per zip code in June 2020. Darker shades of red indicate a higher number of reports relative to lighter shades.

First, it's striking how dark zip code 11226 is in Brooklyn. Over 8000 reports stem from 11226 only. Second, the reports of fireworks are generally from Harlem, Washington Heights and Flatbush - communities where a large number of people of color reside. It is not a conicidence that these are also lower income neighborhoods relative to other areas in the five boroughs. Zip code 11226, for example, has a median income of $52,729 whereas the median for Kings County is $62,050 according to data from [NY HomeTown Locator](https://newyork.hometownlocator.com) in 2020. I am unsure as to how we make sense of the data in this scenario, but it is extremely odd that the zip code with the largest number of reports has more than twice as many reported incidents than that of the zip code with the second largest number of reports (10032 in Washington Heights with 723 reports in June).
