Social media has highlighted a surge in fireworks being set off in June of 2020. 

I pull 311 data to explore the proliferation of reports of illegal fireworks being set off in New York City from the beginning of the month to the end of the month. 

Additionally, I examine the total number of reports in June from 2010 to 2020 to find out whether or not June 2020 is truly an anomaly.
