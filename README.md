# Tracking Reported Cases of Illegal Fireworks in 2020
 
Social media has highlighted a surge in fireworks being set off in June of 2020. Some believe that the lockdowns due to the Coronavirus pandemic have led to pent up energy, and the spike in fireworks usage is explained by the desperate need for people to release. Others believe in more sinister causes. The ballooning number of cases doesn't exist in a vacuum. The murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis has reignited the United States to reflect on racism that has been fraught throughout the nation's history. With increasing tensions fueled by racial divisions and political ideology, there have been calls to defund the police. Some have speculated that local law enforcement bodies have responded to the cries by planting fireworks into communities across the five boroughs as a wartime tactic.

I don't have an answer. 

However, I analyze the number of reported cases of fireworks being set off illegally to 311 to answer whether or not there is empirical evidence to back up the anecdotal tales. From the plots below, it's clear that June 2020 is an anomoly. In the first subplot I compare the number of incidents reported to 311 in June of 2020 to the number of incidents reported in June of 2019. First, it's clear that as we approach the Fourth of July, the number of reports explodes. It remains high and even increases, reaching its peak on the holiday as expected. Second, it may be plausible that this trend held in 2019, so it may not be out of the normal. However, it's clear that the number of reported cases in the previous year does not even come close to the levels in 2020. Even on the Fourth - when we expect people to celebrate - the number of reported incidents is pale in comparison to what we observe this year. 

Arguably, it may be insufficient to compare two years of data. Yet the story holds in the second subplot. When comparing the total number of illegal fireworks being set off in June over the past decade, it's clear that 2020 is not normal. The bars that represent the number of reports from 2010 to 2019 are almost non-existant when placed on a set of axes alongisde the 2020 data.

Although the data is atyptical, there is a persistent argument that New York City residents are traveling across state lines to purchase fireworks because they are illegal in New York State. However, it's unlikely that people are traveling and spending income on pyrotechnics for entertainment in the midst of a global pandemic that has led to unemployment levels observed during the Great Depression,
