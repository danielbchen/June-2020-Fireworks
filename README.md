# Tracking Reported Cases of Illegal Fireworks in 2020
 
Social media has highlighted a surge in fireworks being set off in June of 2020. Some believe that the lockdowns due to the Coronavirus pandemic have led to pent up energy, and the spike in fireworks usage is explained by the desperate need for people to release. Others believe in more sinister causes. The ballooning number of cases doesn't exist in a vacuum. The murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis has reignited the United States to reflect on racism that has been fraught throughout the nation's history. With increasing tensions fueled by racial divisions and political ideology, there have been calls to defund the police. Some have speculated that local law enforcement bodies have responded to the cries by planting fireworks into communities across the five boroughs as a wartime tactic.

I don't have an answer. 

However, I analyze the number of reported cases of fireworks being set off illegally to 311 to answer whether or not there is empirical evidence to back up the anecdotal tales. From the plots below, it's clear that June 2020 is an anomoly. In the first subplot I compare the number of incidents reported to 311 in June of 2020 to the number of incidents reported in June of 2019. First, it's clear that as we approach the Fourth of July, the number of reports explodes. It remains high and even increases, reaching its peak on the holiday as expected. Second, it may be plausible that this trend held in 2019, so it may not be out of the normal. However, it's clear that the number of reported cases in the previous year does not even come close to the levels in 2020. Even on the Fourth - when we expect people to celebrate - the number of reported incidents is pale in comparison to what we observe this year. 

Arguably, it may be insufficient to compare two years of data. Yet the story holds in the second subplot. When comparing the total number of illegal fireworks being set off in June over the past decade, it's clear that 2020 is not normal. The bars that represent the number of reports from 2010 to 2019 are almost non-existant when placed on a set of axes alongisde the 2020 data.

Although the data is atyptical, there is a persistent argument that New York City residents are traveling across state lines to purchase fireworks because they are illegal in New York State. However, it's unlikely that people are traveling and spending income on pyrotechnics for entertainment in the midst of a global pandemic that has led to unemployment levels observed during the Great Depression. 

For the second part of this analysis, I explore the location in which illegal fireworks are reported. Luckily, 311 provides the zip code that corresponds to a report. While the zip code of the reporter is not identical to the zip code of the incident, I assume that the neighborhoods are close enough in proximity. It would be unlikely that a reporter in Union Square would call in to 311 with a complaint of fireworks being set off across the bridge in Brooklyn. The choropleth below shows the number of reported cases of illegal fireworks per zip code in June 2020. Darker shades of red indicate a higher number of reports relative to lighter shades.

First, it's striking how dark zip code 11226 is in Brooklyn. Over 8000 reports stem from 11226 only. Second, the reports of fireworks are generally from Harlem and Flatbush - two communities where a large number of people of color reside. It is not a conicidence that these are also lower income neighborhoods relative to other areas in the five boroughs. Zip code 11226, for example, has a median income of $52,729 whereas the median for Kings County is $62,050 according to data from [NY HomeTown Locator](https://newyork.hometownlocator.com) in 2020. It's highly unlikely that these residents are 1) driving across state lines to 2) purchase fireworks and 3) return to their neighborhoods to set them off in the midst of a pandemic that has crippled the financial livelihoods of people across the nation unless the barriers to access are signficantly lower. Even if there was a steep discount, I still find it difficult to believe that easier access led to an explosion of reports in one specific neighborhood where the number of reports is two times as larger as that of the zip code (10032 in Washington Heights) with the second largest number of reports. 

I do not have the evidence to conclude whether people were indeed extremely bored and felt such a strong desire to purchase and set off fireworks or whether there was a more sinister dynamic.
