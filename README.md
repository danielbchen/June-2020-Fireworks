# Tracking Reported Cases of Illegal Fireworks in 2020
 
Social media has highlighted a surge in fireworks being set off in June of 2020. Some believe that the lockdowns due to the Coronavirus pandemic has led to pent up energy, and the spike in fireworks usage is explained by the desperate need for people to release. Others believe in more sinister causes. The ballooning number of cases doesn't exist in a vacuum. The murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis has reignited the United States to reflect on racism that has been fraught throughout the nation's history. With increasing tensions fueled by racial divisions and political ideology, there have been calls to defund the police. Some have speculated that local law enforcement bodies have responded to the cries by planting fireworks into communities across the five boroughs as a wartime tactic.
